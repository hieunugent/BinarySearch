# BinarySearch
  - a function will take a sorted array of integers as well as a target integer.
  - the function should use the BinarySearch algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is
  - otherwise return -1
  - input array = [0,1,2,3,4,6] target 2 
  - output : 2.
# Solution
  - go to midpoint of array compare with the target
  - if the target is greater than the mid value, move to the right mid
  - else move to the left mid,
  - equal reture mid index.
